The project is based on the titanic ship wreck. The `training set` will be used to build a machine learning model. The model will be based on features like passengers, gender and class and also the creation of additional feature.

The `test set` will be used to see how well the model performs on data never seen before by the model. for the test sets, the ground truth values are not provided for each passengers.

`Gender_submssion.csv` which generaliseds that only female passengers survived the shipwreck.
