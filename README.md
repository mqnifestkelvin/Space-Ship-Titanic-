This project is based on fictional data. It is described as follows; The spaceship titanic was an interstellar passenger liner recendly launced. It had an approximate sum of about 13,000 passengers. The vessel set out on a voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orditing nearby stars.

While around Alpha Centuri en route to its first destination, the torrid 55 Cancri E- the unwary "Spaceship Titanic" collided with a spacetime anomally as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.
